The Great War, usually referred to as World War 1, was a worldwide battle that raged 
from 1914 to 1918. With an estimated nine million combatants and seven million 
civilian casualties, it was the bloodiest conflict in modern history. Most of the 
world's countries, including all of the great powers, participated in the conflict, 
which was fought between two military coalitions led by France, Russia, and the 
United Kingdom, respectively, and the Central Powers (led by Germany, 
Austria-Hungary, and the Ottoman Empire). 

The intricate web of imperialism, nationalism, political and military alliances, and 
mutual mistrust that grew among the European countries in the late 19th and early 
20th centuries is largely recognised as the root cause of World War 1.
